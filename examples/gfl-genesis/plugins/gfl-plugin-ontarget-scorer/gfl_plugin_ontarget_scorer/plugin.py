        DeepHF uses an RNN-based model with biofeature engineering to predict sgRNA activity

        The DeepHF model:
        1. Uses RNN (LSTM) to capture sequence order and contextual relationships
        2. Incorporates biological features like GC content, dinucleotide frequencies
        3. Models long-term dependencies in sgRNA sequences
        4. Trained on large-scale experimental datasets

        For this implementation, we're using a simplified model that captures the key principles:
        - GC content around 50% is optimal for CRISPR efficiency
        - Sequence length around 20bp is optimal
        - Dinucleotide frequencies affect efficiency
