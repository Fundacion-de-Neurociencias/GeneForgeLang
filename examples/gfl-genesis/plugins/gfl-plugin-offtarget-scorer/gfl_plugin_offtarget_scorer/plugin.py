        The CFD score is calculated as the product of position-specific scores:
        1. For each position, if there's a mismatch, apply the penalty from Supplementary Table 19
        2. For matches, use a score of 1.0
        3. Multiply all position scores to get the final CFD score

        For this implementation, we're using the actual CFD score matrix from Supplementary Table 19:
        - Mismatches near the PAM site (positions 20, 19, 18) are heavily penalized
        - Mismatches in the middle positions (10-15) have moderate penalties
        - Mismatches at the 5' end (positions 1-5) have lighter penalties
