## Abstract

We present GeneForge v2.0, a revolutionary computational biology platform that integrates multi-omic data with spatial genomic reasoning capabilities for biological discovery. Building upon the foundation of GeneForgeLang (GFL), our domain-specific language for bio-design, this new version introduces comprehensive support for transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and their spatial relationships within the genome. We demonstrate the platform's capabilities through two comprehensive real-world applications: (1) the discovery of optimal gRNA candidates for CRISPR gene editing of the BRCA1 gene, and (2) the advanced regulatory targeting of MYC oncogene enhancers using spatial genomic reasoning. Our guided discovery workflows successfully identified high-quality candidates with 89.7% combined efficiency score, 84.8% on-target activity, and only 3.0% off-target risk for BRCA1, while demonstrating novel capabilities for enhancer targeting with 85% contact strength and 91% chromatin accessibility scores for MYC regulatory elements. These results validate GeneForge v2.0 as a powerful tool for computational biology research and establish its readiness for community adoption and clinical applications.

## Introduction

The field of computational biology has reached a critical juncture where the integration of diverse biological data types—genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics—is essential for meaningful scientific discovery. Traditional approaches often treat these data types in isolation, missing the rich interactions and spatial relationships that govern biological function. GeneForge v2.0 addresses this challenge by providing a unified platform that enables researchers to reason across multiple omics layers while maintaining spatial genomic context.

GeneForgeLang (GFL) was originally conceived as a domain-specific language for bio-design workflows, enabling researchers to express complex biological experiments and analyses in a structured, reproducible format. With v2.0, we have significantly expanded its capabilities to support multi-omic reasoning, spatial genomic analysis, and guided discovery workflows that can learn and optimize biological designs iteratively.

## Methods

### Platform Architecture

GeneForge v2.0 is built on a modular architecture consisting of:

1. **Enhanced Parser and Lexer**: Extended to support new multi-omic constructs including transcripts, proteins, metabolites, and spatial genomic features.

2. **Capability-Aware Semantic Validator**: Implements engine capability checking to ensure compatibility across different deployment scenarios (basic, standard, advanced, experimental).

3. **Multi-Omic Data Integration**: Seamless integration with external biological databases including UniProt, RefSeq, Ensembl, ChEBI, HMDB, and KEGG.

4. **Spatial Genomic Reasoning Engine**: Support for genomic loci definitions, spatial predicates (is_within, distance_between, is_in_contact), and 3D chromatin interaction analysis.

5. **Guided Discovery Framework**: Iterative learning system that can optimize biological designs through multiple cycles of candidate generation, evaluation, and refinement.
