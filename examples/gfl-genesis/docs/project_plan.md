# GFL Genesis Project Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the detailed plan for the GFL Genesis project: "Optimization of Guide RNA (gRNA) for TP53 Gene Editing through AI-Guided Discovery with GeneForgeLang."

## Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Setup and Plugin Development (Weeks 1-4)
- [ ] Create project repository structure
- [ ] Develop `gfl-plugin-ontarget-scorer` plugin
- [ ] Develop `gfl-plugin-offtarget-scorer` plugin
- [ ] Develop `gfl-crispr-evaluator` orchestrator plugin
- [ ] Create schema definitions for CRISPR data types
- [ ] Set up testing framework for plugins

### Phase 2: Data Acquisition and Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] Download GRCh38 reference genome
- [ ] Obtain TP53 gene annotations
- [ ] Integrate data into plugin workflows
- [ ] Validate data processing pipelines

### Phase 3: GFL Workflow Development (Weeks 7-8)
- [ ] Develop `genesis.gfl` workflow script
- [ ] Test workflow with mock data
- [ ] Validate IO contracts and schema usage
- [ ] Optimize workflow parameters

### Phase 4: Execution and Analysis (Weeks 9-10)
- [ ] Run full GFL workflow on TP53 gene
- [ ] Analyze results and identify top candidates
- [ ] Compare results with baseline methods
- [ ] Validate top candidates (computational validation)

### Phase 5: Documentation and Dissemination (Weeks 11-12)
- [ ] Prepare preprint for bioRxiv
- [ ] Create project blog post
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Publish plugins to GeneForge Hub

## Resource Requirements

### Personnel
- 1 Bioinformatics Researcher (50% time)
- 1 Software Developer (50% time)
- 1 Computational Biologist (25% time)

### Computational Resources
- High-performance computing cluster access
- Storage for reference genome data (~30GB)
- Memory requirements for BLAST searches

### Software Dependencies
- GeneForgeLang v1.0.0
- Python 3.9+
- Required Python packages for plugins
- BLAST+ toolkit for off-target searches

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- Identification of gRNAs with >0.8 on-target efficiency and <0.1 off-target risk
- Demonstration of superior performance compared to exhaustive search methods

### Secondary Metrics
- Successful execution of GFL `guided_discovery` workflow
- Publication of plugins to GeneForge Hub
- Preprint submission to bioRxiv
- Project blog post with results

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Plugin Integration Issues**: Mitigated by following GFL plugin development guidelines
- **Data Processing Bottlenecks**: Mitigated by optimizing algorithms and using HPC resources
- **Model Accuracy**: Mitigated by validating with known gRNA datasets

### Schedule Risks
- **Delays in Data Acquisition**: Mitigated by identifying alternative data sources
- **Plugin Development Complexity**: Mitigated by starting with simplified models

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular progress reviews
- Early and frequent testing
- Collaboration with GFL core team for technical support

## Deliverables

### Code
- Three GFL plugins published as open-source packages
- GFL workflow script for gRNA design
- Documentation and examples for all components

### Scientific
- Preprint submitted to bioRxiv
- Project blog post with key findings
- Presentation at relevant conference (target: ISMB or RECOMB)

### Community
- Plugins published to GeneForge Hub
- Tutorial for using GFL for CRISPR design
- Contribution to GFL documentation
