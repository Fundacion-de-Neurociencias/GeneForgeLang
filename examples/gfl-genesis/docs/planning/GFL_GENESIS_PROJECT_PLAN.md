# GFL Genesis Project Plan: Scientific Validation Initiative

## Overview

The GFL Genesis project is the cornerstone of Phase 3's scientific validation initiative. This project will demonstrate the real-world value of GeneForgeLang v1.0.0 by solving a challenging problem in computational biology: optimizing guide RNA (gRNA) sequences for the TP53 tumor suppressor gene using GFL's advanced `guided_discovery` workflow.

## Connection to Phase 3 Initiatives

This project simultaneously advances all three Phase 3 initiatives:

### 1. Developer Experience (LSP)
- Validates the enhanced error reporting and schema validation features
- Demonstrates the power of custom schema types in real workflows
- Provides concrete use cases for LSP features like intelligent autocompletion

### 2. Plugin Ecosystem
- Creates three reference plugins that showcase best practices
- Establishes patterns for plugin development and distribution
- Populates the GeneForge Hub with high-quality, scientifically validated plugins

### 3. Scientific Validation
- Serves as the flagship scientific validation project
- Generates tangible evidence of GFL's value in real research
- Creates a high-impact reference use case for the community

## Project Details

### Scientific Objective
Design optimal gRNA sequences for the TP53 gene that maximize on-target cutting efficiency while minimizing off-target effects, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional approaches.

### Technical Implementation
- Use GFL's `guided_discovery` block for AI-driven optimization
- Leverage custom schema types for data integrity
- Implement specialized plugins for CRISPR scoring
- Validate workflow with IO contracts

### Expected Outcomes
1. **Scientific**: Publication demonstrating GFL's effectiveness in CRISPR design
2. **Technical**: Three open-source plugins for the GFL ecosystem
3. **Community**: High-impact reference workflow showcasing GFL's capabilities

## Timeline

### Months 1-2: Foundation
- Complete plugin development and testing
- Set up data processing pipelines
- Validate GFL workflow with mock data

### Months 3-4: Execution
- Run full-scale gRNA optimization
- Analyze results and identify top candidates
- Compare performance with baseline methods

### Months 5-6: Validation and Dissemination
- Prepare preprint for bioRxiv
- Create project blog post and documentation
- Publish plugins to GeneForge Hub

## Resources Required

- 1 Bioinformatics researcher (50% time)
- 1 Software developer (50% time)
- Access to computational resources for genome analysis
- Reference genome data (GRCh38) and annotations

## Success Metrics

### Primary
- Identification of gRNAs with >0.8 on-target efficiency and <0.1 off-target risk
- Demonstration of 2x improvement in design efficiency compared to exhaustive search

### Secondary
- Successful execution of GFL `guided_discovery` workflow
- Positive reception of preprint in scientific community
- Adoption of plugins by other researchers

## Risk Mitigation

- Regular collaboration with GFL core team for technical support
- Early and frequent testing with mock data
- Flexible approach to model implementation (starting with simplified versions)

## Impact

The GFL Genesis project will serve as the definitive proof of GFL's value, establishing it as a serious tool for genomic research while simultaneously advancing all three Phase 3 initiatives. The project's success will catalyze broader adoption of GFL in the scientific community.
