# GeneForgeLang Examples

This directory contains example projects and use cases demonstrating the capabilities of GeneForgeLang (GFL).

## Available Examples

### [GFL Genesis](gfl-genesis/)
A comprehensive example project showcasing advanced GFL features including:
- Custom plugins
- Schema definitions
- Complex workflow designs
- Testing frameworks

This project serves as a template for building sophisticated genomic workflows with GFL.

### Simple Examples
- [example1.gfl](example1.gfl) - Basic GFL workflow example
- [example2.gfl](example2.gfl) - Simple design and optimization workflow
- [example_crispr_optimization.gfl](../example_crispr_optimization.gfl) - CRISPR optimization workflow
- [example_protein_design.gfl](../example_protein_design.gfl) - Protein design workflow

## Usage

Each example can be executed using the GFL CLI tools:

```bash
# Parse and validate a GFL file
gfl-parse example1.gfl
gfl-validate example1.gfl

# Execute a GFL workflow
gfl-execute example1.gfl
```

For the GFL Genesis project, refer to its specific documentation in the [gfl-genesis/](gfl-genesis/) directory.
