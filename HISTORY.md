# GeneForgeLang Development History

## Early Development (2023-2024)

### Initial Concept
Started as a side project to make genomic workflows more accessible. The idea came from working with complex bioinformatics pipelines that were hard to reproduce and share.

### First Implementation
- Basic YAML parser for genomic experiments
- Simple validation system
- Focus on CRISPR and gene editing workflows

### Key Milestones

**v0.1.0 (March 2024)**
- First working parser
- Basic experiment validation
- Simple CLI interface

**v0.2.0 (June 2024)**
- Added plugin system
- Web interface prototype
- Better error handling

**v0.3.0 (September 2024)**
- Major refactor for better performance
- Enhanced validation with type checking
- Improved documentation

**v1.0.0 (Current)**
- Stable API for external integrations
- Comprehensive plugin ecosystem
- Production-ready features

## Development Notes

### Design Decisions
- Chose YAML over JSON for better readability
- Plugin system inspired by existing bioinformatics tools
- Web interface built with FastAPI for performance

### Challenges Overcome
- Balancing simplicity with power
- Making the language extensible without being complex
- Ensuring backward compatibility during major refactors

### Community Contributions
- Several plugins contributed by early users
- Feedback helped shape the API design
- Bug reports led to better error messages

## Future Plans
- Better integration with existing bioinformatics tools
- More sophisticated validation rules
- Performance optimizations for large workflows
