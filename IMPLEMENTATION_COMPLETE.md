# üéâ GFL Spatial Genomic Capabilities + Capability-Aware Validator - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ Successfully Delivered

I have successfully implemented both major initiatives for the GFL ecosystem:

### 1. **GFL Spatial Genomic Capabilities** ‚úÖ
**Evolution: GFL with Spatial Genomic Awareness**

#### **Loci Block - Genomic Coordinates**
- Define named genomic regions with chromosome, start/end positions
- Support for genomic elements (promoters, enhancers, genes)
- YAML-based syntax for easy editing and integration

#### **Spatial Predicates in Rules**
- `is_within(element, locus)`: Check if element is within genomic locus
- `distance_between(element_a, element_b)`: Calculate genomic distance
- `is_in_contact(element_a, element_b, hic_map)`: Check 3D contact using Hi-C data
- Complex logical combinations with AND, OR, NOT operators

#### **Enhanced Simulate Block - What-If Reasoning**
- Hypothetical actions (move elements, change activity levels)
- Query consequences based on spatial rules
- Support for complex simulation scenarios
- Integration with spatial genomic reasoning engine

### 2. **GFL Capability-Aware Validator** ‚úÖ
**Next Initiative: Validator Consciente de Capacidades**

#### **Engine Capability Checking**
- Validates GFL code against specific engine capabilities
- Generates warnings (not errors) for unsupported features
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy GFL features

#### **Multiple Engine Types**
- **Basic**: Core GFL features (experiment, analyze, design, optimize, branch, metadata)
- **Standard**: Features up to v1.2.0 (includes rules, simulate, hypothesis, timeline)
- **Advanced**: All features including spatial genomic capabilities (v1.3.0)
- **Experimental**: Cutting-edge features and integrations

#### **Feature Dependency Validation**
- Checks if all required dependencies for a feature are supported
- Prevents execution of features with missing prerequisites
- Provides clear dependency information

## üß¨ Scientific Value Achieved

### **Captures Paper Findings**
The implementation directly captures the scientific findings about Sox2 promoter-enhancer interactions:
- **Spatial Dependencies**: Promoter-enhancer efficiency depends on 3D contact
- **Relocation Penalties**: Moving elements outside native loci reduces activity
- **Distance Effects**: Genomic distance affects regulatory efficiency

### **Enables New Research**
- **In Silico Experiments**: Test hypotheses before expensive lab work
- **Spatial Design**: Design synthetic circuits with spatial awareness
- **Disease Modeling**: Model effects of chromosomal rearrangements
- **Evolutionary Analysis**: Study how spatial organization evolves

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Parser Extensions**
- **Lexer**: Added 20+ new keywords for spatial genomic concepts
- **Grammar**: Extended parser rules for loci, rules, and simulate blocks
- **YAML Support**: Full YAML parsing with proper structure validation

### **Interpreter Enhancements**
- **Spatial Condition Evaluation**: Complete implementation of spatial predicates
- **Rule Engine**: Rule-based activity determination with spatial awareness
- **Simulation Engine**: What-if reasoning with hypothetical actions
- **Symbol Table**: Enhanced to store loci, rules, and simulation contexts

### **Validator Enhancements**
- **Capability System**: Comprehensive feature definitions and dependencies
- **Engine Checking**: Support for multiple engine types and capabilities
- **Warning System**: Capability warnings without breaking script validity
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing validation pipeline

    end: 181711758
    elements:
      - id: "Sox2_Promoter"
        type: "promoter"

rules:
  - id: "GatekeeperRule"
    description: "Promoter efficiently regulated by enhancer only if both in native loci and 3D contact"

simulate:
  name: "Sox2_Promoter_Relocation_Experiment"

### **Capability-Aware Validation**
```python
from gfl.semantic_validator import validate_with_engine_type
from gfl.parser import parse_gfl

# Parse GFL content
ast = parse_gfl(gfl_content)

# Validate for specific engine type
result = validate_with_engine_type(ast, "standard")

# Check results
print(f"Errors: {len(result.errors)}")
print(f"Warnings: {len(result.warnings)}")

# Show capability warnings
for warning in result.warnings:
    if hasattr(warning, 'feature'):
