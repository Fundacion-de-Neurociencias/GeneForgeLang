# GFL Genesis Project Summary

## Project Overview

The GFL Genesis project represents the first major scientific validation of GeneForgeLang v1.0.0 through a real-world application in computational biology. This project will use GFL's advanced `guided_discovery` block to design optimal guide RNA (gRNA) sequences for the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, demonstrating the language's capabilities in AI-driven genomic workflow automation.

## Key Components

### 1. GFL Workflow
- **Script**: `genesis.gfl` - Orchestrate the entire gRNA design process
- **Features**: Utilizes `guided_discovery` block with active learning optimization
- **Integration**: Leverages custom schema types and IO contracts for data integrity

### 2. Custom Plugins
Three specialized plugins have been developed for this project:

1. **gfl-plugin-ontarget-scorer**: Predicts on-target cutting efficiency using DeepHF model
2. **gfl-plugin-offtarget-scorer**: Identifies and scores potential off-target sites using CFD scoring
3. **gfl-crispr-evaluator**: Orchestrator plugin that combines both scorers

### 3. Schema Definitions
Custom data types defined in `schemas/crispr_types.yml`:
- `GRNA_Sequence_List`: List of candidate gRNA sequences
- `GRNA_Evaluation_Table`: Table of gRNA sequences with evaluation scores

### 4. Scientific Objective
Design gRNAs for TP53 gene that:
- Maximize on-target cutting efficiency (>0.8 score)
- Minimize off-target risk (<0.1 score)
- Outperform traditional exhaustive search methods

## Expected Outcomes

### Scientific Deliverables
1. **Optimized gRNA Set**: Collection of TP53-targeting gRNAs with validated performance
2. **Preprint Publication**: Manuscript for bioRxiv detailing methodology and results
3. **Project Blog Post**: Accessible summary of findings for the broader community

### Technical Deliverables
1. **Open-Source Plugins**: Three GFL plugins published under permissive licenses
2. **GeneForge Hub Submission**: Plugins submitted to the official GFL plugin registry
3. **Reference Workflow**: Complete GFL workflow demonstrating advanced AI capabilities

### Community Impact
1. **Ecosystem Validation**: Demonstration of GFL's practical utility in real research
2. **Best Practices**: Documentation of plugin development and workflow design patterns
3. **Educational Resource**: Tutorial for using GFL in CRISPR applications
