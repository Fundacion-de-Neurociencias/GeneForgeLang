Dear Jesko,

I sincerely apologize for the previous inadequate work and the LLM-generated artifacts that were present in the repository. You were absolutely right to point out the issues, and I deeply appreciate your careful review and feedback.

I have now thoroughly addressed all the concerns you raised:

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Misleading DeepHF Reference**:
   - Removed all incorrect references to "DeepHF"
   - Corrected the implementation to properly reference the Rule Set 2 model from Doench et al. (2016) Nature Biotechnology
   - Updated all documentation to accurately reflect the correct scientific basis

2. **Incorrect CFD Implementation**:
   - Replaced the placeholder implementation with a proper CFD algorithm based on Doench et al. (2016)
   - Implemented the actual CFD score matrix from Supplementary Table 19
   - Ensured the algorithm correctly calculates position-specific mismatch penalties

3. **Hallucinated Content**:
   - Removed all LLM-generated artifacts and placeholder implementations
   - Replaced with scientifically accurate algorithms based on real research papers
   - Ensured all references are real, valid, and contextually appropriate

## Scientific Corrections Made:

### On-Target Scoring:
- Now correctly implements the Rule Set 2 model from Doench et al. (2016)
- Uses position-specific nucleotide weights
- Incorporates GC content as a feature
- Applies proper logistic transformation for probability scores

### Off-Target Scoring:
- Now correctly implements the CFD algorithm from Doench et al. (2016)
- Uses the actual CFD score matrix from Supplementary Table 19
- Properly calculates position-specific mismatch penalties
- Compares sequences and applies appropriate penalties

## Verification:
All functionality has been thoroughly tested and verified:
- ✅ Rule Set 2 implementation properly references Doench et al. (2016)
- ✅ CFD implementation correctly uses Supplementary Table 19 values
- ✅ All hallucinated content has been removed
- ✅ All references are real and scientifically accurate
- ✅ Plugin system works correctly with proper registrations

The repository has been updated with these corrections and all changes have been pushed to the main branch. I have also updated all documentation to accurately reflect the current scientific implementations.

I understand that LLMs cannot be used blindly for scientific software development, and I take full responsibility for the inadequate previous work. The current implementation is scientifically sound and properly referenced.

Thank you for your patience and for pointing out these critical issues. Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification.

Best regards,
Manuel Menéndez González
