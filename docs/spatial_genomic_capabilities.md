# GFL Spatial Genomic Capabilities

## Overview

GeneForge Language (GFL) has been enhanced with spatial genomic awareness, enabling researchers to express and reason about genomic geography, 3D topology, and spatial relationships between genomic elements. This evolution transforms GFL from a workflow orchestration language into a true bio-design and genomic reasoning language.

## New Features

### 1. Loci Block - Genomic Coordinates

The `loci` block allows you to define named genomic regions with their coordinates and constituent elements.

#### Syntax
```gfl
loci {
    id: "LocusName",
    chromosome: "chr3",
    start: 181708858,
    end: 181711758,
    elements: [
        {
            id: "ElementName",
            type: "promoter|enhancer|gene|other"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Example
```gfl
loci {
    id: "Sox2_GeneLocus",
    chromosome: "chr3",
    start: 181708858,
    end: 181711758,
    elements: [
        {
            id: "Sox2_Promoter",
            type: "promoter"
        },
        {
            id: "Sox2_GeneBody",
            type: "gene"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 2. Spatial Predicates in Rules

The `rules` block now supports spatial predicates that can reason about genomic geography and 3D topology.

#### Available Predicates

- `is_within(element, locus)`: Checks if an element is within a genomic locus
- `distance_between(element_a, element_b)`: Calculates distance between two elements
- `is_in_contact(element_a, element_b, using: hic_map)`: Checks 3D contact using Hi-C data

#### Syntax
```gfl
rules {
    id: "RuleName",
    description: "Rule description",
    if: spatial_condition,
    then: action_list
}
```

#### Example
```gfl
rules {
    id: "GatekeeperRule",
    description: "Promoter is efficiently regulated by enhancer only if both are in native loci and in 3D contact",
    if: is_within(Sox2_Promoter, Sox2_GeneLocus) AND
        is_within(Sox2_Enhancer, Sox2_EnhancerLocus) AND
        is_in_contact(Sox2_Promoter, Sox2_Enhancer, using: "embryonic_stem_cell_hic.cool"),
    then: set_activity(Sox2_GeneBody, level: "high")
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Simulate Block

The `simulate` block enables what-if reasoning and in silico experiments based on spatial genomic rules.

#### Syntax
```gfl
simulate {
    name: "SimulationName",
    description: "What happens if...",
    action: hypothetical_action,
    query: [
        get_activity(element)
    ]
}
```

#### Example
```gfl
simulate {
    name: "Sox2_Promoter_Relocation_Experiment",
    description: "What happens to Sox2 activity if we move its promoter elsewhere?",
    action: move(Sox2_Promoter, to: "chr3:190000000"),
    query: [
        get_activity(Sox2_GeneBody)
    ]
}
```

## Use Cases

## Examples

See the following example files:
- `spatial_genomic_minimal_example.gfl`: Basic usage
- `spatial_genomic_sox2_example.gfl`: Sox2 gene regulation example
- `spatial_genomic_complex_example.gfl`: Multi-gene regulatory network

## Getting Started

1. Define your genomic loci using the `loci` block
2. Create spatial rules using the `rules` block with spatial predicates
3. Run simulations using the `simulate` block to test hypotheses
4. Analyze results to gain insights into spatial genomic relationships

This enhanced GFL language enables researchers to capture and reason about the complex spatial organization of the genome, opening new possibilities for understanding gene regulation and designing synthetic biological systems.
