# Generative Design with the `design` Block

## Introduction

The `design` block represents a revolutionary advancement in GeneForgeLang, introducing **automated generative design** capabilities for biological entities. This block allows researchers to specify de novo design tasks that go beyond simple analysis of existing data, enabling the **intelligent creation** of new sequences, structures, and biological compounds.

Inspired by recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, the `design` block integrates specialized deep learning models in biology to:

- **Generate** new protein, DNA, RNA sequences with desired properties
- **Optimize** bioactive compounds for specific therapeutic targets
- **Create** diverse libraries of candidates for experimental screening
- **Incorporate** realistic biological and physical constraints into the design process

This approach is especially transformative in areas such as drug discovery, protein engineering, and synthetic biology, where the ability to design novel biological entities is fundamental to scientific innovation.

## Block Structure

The `design` block consists of six main components that fully define a generative design task:

### `entity` - Biological Entity Type

Specifies what type of biological entity will be designed. This field determines the design space and applicable constraints.

**Supported Entities:**

- **`ProteinSequence`**: Amino acid sequences for proteins
- **`DNASequence`**: DNA nucleotide sequences
- **`RNASequence`**: RNA nucleotide sequences
- **`SmallMolecule`**: Small chemical compounds (< 1000 Da)
- **`Peptide`**: Short peptides (< 50 amino acids)
- **`Antibody`**: Antibodies and antibody fragments

**Syntax:**
```yaml
entity: EntityType
```

**Examples:**
```yaml
entity: ProteinSequence    # Protein design
entity: SmallMolecule     # Drug design
entity: DNASequence       # Primer, promoter design, etc.
```

### `model` - Generative Model

Specifies the artificial intelligence model that will be used to generate the new biological entities. Each model is specialized in a specific entity type and methodology.

**Available Models:**

- **`ProteinGeneratorVAE`**: Variational autoencoder for proteins
- **`DNADesignerGAN`**: Generative adversarial network for DNA
- **`MoleculeTransformer`**: Transformer for small molecules
- **`SequenceOptimizer`**: Evolutionary optimizer for sequences
- **`StructurePredictor`**: Structural predictor with generative capability

**Syntax:**
```yaml
model: ModelName
```

**Examples:**
```yaml
model: ProteinGeneratorVAE    # For proteins with VAE
model: MoleculeTransformer    # For molecules with Transformer
```

### `objective` - Design Objective

Defines the properties that should be optimized during the design process. It must contain exactly one of the following main directives, and optionally a specific target.

**Main Directives:**
- **`maximize`**: Maximize a property (e.g.: affinity, stability)
- **`minimize`**: Minimize a property (e.g.: toxicity, aggregation)

**Optional Field:**
- **`target`**: Specifies the specific context or target

**Syntax:**
```yaml
objective:
  maximize: property
  # Or alternatively:
  minimize: property
  target: specific_context
```

**Examples:**
```yaml
# Maximize binding affinity
objective:
  maximize: binding_affinity
  target: ACE2_receptor

# Minimize toxicity
objective:
  minimize: toxicity

# Maximize thermal stability
objective:
  maximize: thermal_stability
  target: 60C
```

### `constraints` - Design Constraints

Optional list of constraints that generated entities must satisfy. These constraints help guide the generative process toward biologically viable and experimentally feasible solutions.

**Common Constraint Types:**

- **Length**: `length(min, max)` - Allowed length range
- **Content**: `gc_content(min, max)` - GC content for DNA/RNA
- **Motifs**: `has_motif('sequence')` - Presence of specific sequences
- **Properties**: `synthesizability > 0.7` - Synthesis feasibility
- **Structure**: `no_aggregation_prone_regions` - Avoid problematic regions

**Syntax:**
```yaml
constraints:
  - constraint1
  - constraint2
  - constraint3
```

**Examples:**
```yaml
constraints:
  - length(120, 150)                    # Length between 120-150 residues
  - synthesizability > 0.8              # High synthesizability
  - has_motif('RGD')                   # Contains RGD motif
  - gc_content(0.4, 0.6)               # Balanced GC content
  - molecular_weight < 500             # Molecular weight for drug-likeness
  - no_stop_codons                     # No premature stop codons
```

### `count` - Number of Candidates

Specifies how many different entities should be generated. This number must be a positive integer, typically between 1 and 1000 depending on the application and computational resources.

**Syntax:**
```yaml
count: integer_number
```

**Considerations:**
- **Diversity vs Quality**: More candidates increase diversity but may reduce average quality
- **Computational Resources**: Large numbers require more computing time
- **Downstream Analysis**: Consider experimental analysis capacity downstream

**Examples:**
```yaml
count: 10      # For quick initial validation
count: 100     # For medium-sized screening
count: 1000    # For large screening libraries
```

### `output` - Output Variable

Specifies the name of the variable where generated candidates will be stored for use in subsequent workflow blocks. Must be a valid Python identifier.

**Syntax:**
```yaml
output: variable_name
```

**Naming Rules:**
- Must begin with a letter or underscore
- Can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Cannot be a reserved GFL word

**Examples:**
```yaml
output: designed_proteins      # Designed proteins
output: candidate_molecules    # Candidate molecules
output: optimized_sequences    # Optimized sequences
output: generated_antibodies   # Generated antibodies
```

## Complete Example

The following is a complete example of therapeutic antibody design for COVID-19:

```yaml
metadata:
  experiment_id: COVID_ANTIBODY_DESIGN_001
  researcher: Dr. Elena Rodriguez
  project: covid_therapeutics
  description: Design of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
  date: "2024-01-15"

design:
  # Entity type: antibodies

  # Specialized generative model for antibodies
  model: AntibodyDesignerVAE

  # Objective: maximize binding affinity to viral receptor
  objective:
    maximize: binding_affinity
    target: SARS-CoV-2_spike_protein

  # Design constraints for experimental feasibility
  constraints:
    - length(110, 120)              # Appropriate antibody length
    - synthesizability > 0.85        # High synthesis probability

    - gc_content(0.45, 0.55)        # Balanced GC content for expression

  # Generate 50 candidate antibodies
  count: 50

  # Store results in this variable
  output: covid_antibody_candidates

# Subsequent analysis of generated candidates
analyze:
  tool: AntibodyAnalyzer
  input: covid_antibody_candidates
  metrics:
    - binding_affinity
    - stability_score
    - immunogenicity_risk
  output: analyzed_antibodies

```

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Design

The `design` block supports conditional logic for context-dependent design:

```yaml
design:
  entity: ProteinSequence
  model: ProteinGeneratorVAE
  objective:
    maximize: thermal_stability
    target: "${experimental_temperature}C"
  constraints:
    - length(100, 200)
    - if: "${host_organism} == 'E.coli'"
      then:
        - codon_optimization: E_coli
        - avoid_rare_codons
  count: 100
  output: temperature_optimized_proteins
```

### Multi-Objective Optimization

For complex design tasks with multiple competing objectives:

```yaml
design:
  entity: SmallMolecule
  model: MoleculeTransformer
  objective:
    maximize:
      - binding_affinity
      - solubility
    minimize:
      - toxicity
      - molecular_weight
  constraints:
    - molecular_weight < 500
    - logP < 5
    - hba_count < 10
    - hbd_count < 5
  count: 200
  output: drug_candidates
```

## Integration with Other Blocks

The `design` block seamlessly integrates with other GFL workflow components:

- **`optimize`**: Iteratively improve designs through experimental optimization
- **`analyze`**: Evaluate and characterize generated candidates
- **`refine`**: Filter and improve candidate quality
- **`simulate`**: Predict behavior in biological contexts

This integration enables sophisticated workflows that combine generative design with experimental validation and iterative improvement.

## Performance Considerations

When using the `design` block, consider:

1. **Computational Resources**: Large-scale design tasks may require significant computing power
2. **Model Selection**: Choose models appropriate for your specific design task
3. **Constraint Specification**: Well-defined constraints improve design quality
4. **Validation Strategy**: Plan for experimental validation of generated candidates
5. **Storage Requirements**: Generated candidates may require substantial storage

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic design tasks and gradually increase complexity
2. **Define Clear Objectives**: Precise objectives lead to better design outcomes
3. **Use Realistic Constraints**: Include constraints that reflect experimental reality
4. **Validate Results**: Always experimentally validate generated candidates
5. **Iterate**: Use analysis results to refine and improve subsequent design iterations

The `design` block represents a powerful capability for automated biological design, enabling researchers to harness the power of AI for scientific discovery and innovation.
