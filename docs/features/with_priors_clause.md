# Incorporating Prior Knowledge with the `with_priors` Clause

## Introduction

The `with_priors` clause represents an advanced extension of GeneForgeLang that allows incorporating **prior knowledge** and **statistical information** into generative design and experimental optimization processes. This functionality enables the use of historical data, domain knowledge, and probabilistic constraints to significantly improve the quality and efficiency of artificial intelligence algorithms.

Inspired by Bayesian methodologies and learning with prior information, the `with_priors` clause allows:

- **Incorporating** results from previous experiments as prior information
- **Defining** probability distributions over parameter spaces
- **Specifying** constraints based on domain knowledge
- **Accelerating** convergence of optimization algorithms
- **Improving** the quality of generated designs through informed biases

This capability is especially valuable in genomics, where decades of research have generated a vast body of knowledge that can guide new experiments and designs more efficiently.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Prior Knowledge in Biology

In the context of GeneForgeLang, "priors" can take multiple forms:

- **Parametric Distributions**: Knowledge about typical ranges of experimental parameters
- **Structural Constraints**: Known limitations in the biological design space
- **Historical Results**: Data from previous experiments that inform success probabilities
- **Biological Symmetries**: Known invariances in biological systems
- **Functional Relationships**: Known dependencies between experimental variables

### Integration with Main Blocks

The `with_priors` clause can be associated with:

- **`design` blocks**: To guide the generation of biological entities
- **`optimize` blocks**: To accelerate search in parameter spaces
- **`analyze` blocks**: To incorporate knowledge in statistical analyses

## Clause Structure

### General Syntax

```yaml
main_block:
  # ... block configuration ...

with_priors:
  distributions:
    parameter1: distribution_type(parameters)
    parameter2: distribution_type(parameters)

  constraints:
    - constraint_expression1
    - constraint_expression2

  historical_data:
    source: path_or_reference
    weight: relative_weight

  symmetries:
    - symmetry_type(parameters)

  domain_knowledge:
    rules:
      - rule1
      - rule2
```

### Main Components

#### 1. `distributions` - Prior Distributions

Specifies probability distributions for parameters in the search or design space:

```yaml
with_priors:
  distributions:
    temperature: normal(37.0, 2.0)          # Mean 37°C, std 2°C
    concentration: lognormal(50, 1.5)       # LogNormal for concentrations
    ph_value: beta(7.4, 0.5)               # Beta distribution for pH
    success_rate: uniform(0.6, 0.9)        # Uniform for success rates
```

**Supported Distributions:**
- `normal(mean, std)`: Normal distribution
- `lognormal(mean, std)`: Log-normal for positive values
- `beta(alpha, beta)`: Beta for values in [0,1]
- `gamma(shape, scale)`: Gamma for positive values
- `uniform(min, max)`: Uniform in interval
- `exponential(lambda)`: Exponential for waiting times

#### 2. `constraints` - Probabilistic Constraints

Defines constraints based on domain knowledge:

```yaml
with_priors:
  constraints:
    - P(binding_affinity > 0.8 | structure_type='alpha_helix') > 0.7
    - correlation(gc_content, stability) > 0.3
    - mutual_info(promoter_strength, expression_level) > 2.0
```

#### 3. `historical_data` - Historical Data

Incorporates results from previous experiments:

```yaml
with_priors:
  historical_data:
    source: "experiments_database.csv"
    columns:
      input: ["temp", "conc", "ph"]
      output: "efficiency"
    weight: 0.8                    # Relative weight vs new data
    relevance_filter:
      target_gene: "TP53"          # Only relevant experiments
      date_range: "2020-2024"
```

#### 4. `symmetries` - Biological Symmetries

Specifies known invariances of the system:

```yaml
with_priors:
  symmetries:
    - rotational_symmetry(protein_complex, 4)      # 4x rotational symmetry
    - mirror_symmetry(dna_palindrome)              # Palindrome in DNA
    - translational_invariance(sequence_motif)     # Positional invariance
```

#### 5. `domain_knowledge` - Domain Rules

Incorporates heuristics and known rules:

```yaml
with_priors:
  domain_knowledge:
    rules:
      - "IF gc_content > 0.7 THEN stability += 0.2"
      - "IF has_motif('TATA') THEN promoter_activity *= 1.5"
      - "AVOID stop_codons IN coding_sequences"
    confidence_weights:
      literature_backed: 0.9       # Rules with literature support
      expert_opinion: 0.7          # Expert opinions
      heuristic: 0.5              # General heuristics
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Protein Design with Structural Prior Information

```yaml
design:
  entity: ProteinSequence
  model: ProteinGeneratorVAE
  objective:
    maximize: binding_affinity
    target: ACE2_receptor
  count: 50
  output: informed_designs

with_priors:
  distributions:
    # Length distribution based on known proteins
    sequence_length: normal(150, 25)
    # Hydrophobicity distribution typical
    hydrophobicity: beta(0.4, 0.3)

  historical_data:
    source: "pdb_ace2_binders.json"
    relevance_score: > 0.8
    weight: 0.7

  domain_knowledge:
    rules:
      - "IF has_motif('RGD') THEN binding_score += 0.3"
      - "IF secondary_structure='beta_sheet' THEN stability += 0.2"
      - "AVOID aggregation_prone_regions"

  symmetries:
    - binding_site_symmetry(ACE2_interface, bilateral)
```

### 2. CRISPR Optimization with Historical Data

```yaml
optimize:
  search_space:
    guide_concentration: range(10, 100)
    temperature: range(25, 42)
    incubation_time: choice([2, 4, 6, 8])

  strategy:
    name: BayesianOptimization

  objective:
    maximize: editing_efficiency

  budget:
    max_experiments: 40

  run:
    experiment:
      tool: CRISPR_editor
      params:
        guide_conc: ${guide_concentration}
        temp: ${temperature}
        incubation: ${incubation_time}
      output: editing_results

with_priors:
  distributions:
    # Based on previous successful experiments
    guide_concentration: normal(50, 15)
    temperature: normal(37, 3)

  historical_data:
    source: "crispr_optimization_history.csv"
    columns:
      input: ["guide_conc", "temp", "incubation"]
      output: "efficiency"
    weight: 0.6

  domain_knowledge:
    rules:
      - "IF temp > 40 THEN efficiency *= 0.8"  # High temp reduces efficiency
      - "IF guide_conc < 20 THEN off_target_risk += 0.3"
```

## Advanced Features

### Hierarchical Priors

For complex scenarios with hierarchical knowledge:

```yaml
with_priors:
  hierarchical:
    organism_level:
      temperature: normal(37, 2)
      ph: normal(7.4, 0.2)
    tissue_level:
      if: "${tissue_type} == 'liver'"
      then:
        temperature: normal(37.5, 1.5)
        ph: normal(7.2, 0.1)
```

### Time-Varying Priors

For scenarios where prior knowledge changes over time:

```yaml
with_priors:
  time_varying:
    initial_phase:
      distribution: uniform(25, 42)
      duration: 10 experiments
    adaptive_phase:
      distribution: normal(37, 3)
      update_frequency: 5 experiments
```

## Integration with Other Blocks

The `with_priors` clause seamlessly integrates with other GFL workflow components:

- **`design`**: Inform generative design with prior knowledge
- **`optimize`**: Guide optimization algorithms with informed priors
- **`analyze`**: Enhance analysis with domain knowledge
- **`simulate`**: Improve simulation accuracy with prior information

This integration enables sophisticated workflows that combine prior knowledge with generative design, experimental optimization, and analysis.

## Performance Considerations

When using the `with_priors` clause, consider:

1. **Computational Overhead**: Prior incorporation may add computational complexity
2. **Data Quality**: Ensure historical data is relevant and accurate
3. **Prior Weighting**: Balance prior knowledge with new experimental evidence
4. **Validation**: Always validate that priors improve rather than bias results
5. **Storage Requirements**: Historical data and prior distributions may require significant storage

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic priors and gradually increase complexity
2. **Validate Priors**: Ensure prior knowledge is accurate and relevant
3. **Weight Appropriately**: Balance prior knowledge with new evidence
4. **Monitor Impact**: Track whether priors improve workflow performance
5. **Update Regularly**: Refresh priors as new knowledge becomes available

The `with_priors` clause represents a powerful capability for incorporating domain expertise into AI-driven biological workflows, enabling researchers to leverage accumulated knowledge for more effective scientific discovery.
