# GFL Conformance Test: Invalid Simulation - Missing Query
# Test Case: 06_invalid_simulation_missing_query.gfl
# Purpose: Test validation of simulate block missing query field
# Expected: Should be rejected by semantic validator

  # query:  # MISSING REQUIRED FIELD

# This test validates that the semantic validator correctly identifies
# missing query field in simulate block. The query field is required
# to specify what information should be retrieved after the simulation
# action is performed and rules are applied.
