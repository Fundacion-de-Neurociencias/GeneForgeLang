# GFL Conformance Test: is_within Predicate - Should Pass
# Test Case: 01_is_within_pass.gfl
# Purpose: Test is_within predicate that should evaluate to true
# Expected: Should parse successfully and evaluate to true
# Description for GF Engine: "The engine must evaluate this condition as true."

loci:
  - id: "TestGene_Locus"
    chromosome: "chr1"
    start: 1000000
    end: 1001000
    elements:
      - id: "TestGene_Promoter"
        type: "promoter"

rules:
  - id: "IsWithinTestRule"
    description: "Test rule to verify is_within predicate evaluates correctly"
    if:
      - type: "is_within"
        element: "TestGene_Promoter"
        locus: "TestGene_Locus"
    then:
      - type: "set_activity"
        element: "TestGene_Promoter"
        level: "active"

# This test validates that the is_within predicate correctly evaluates to true
# when an element's coordinates fall within the specified locus bounds.
# The TestGene_Promoter should be considered within TestGene_Locus since
# both are defined in the same coordinate range (1000000-1001000 on chr1).
