# DESCRIPTION: A compliant engine must understand the 'invert' operation.
# It must identify the 'locus(GABRB3_Promoter)' and simulate the inversion of its sequence.

loci:
  - id: GABRB3_Promoter
    type: "promoter"
    chromosome: "chr15"
    start: 28551160
    end: 28552270

simulate:
  action:
    apply_edit:
      tool: "bridge_editor"
      operation:
        invert: locus(GABRB3_Promoter)
  query:
    - expression_is(gene: "GABRB3", level: "silenced")
