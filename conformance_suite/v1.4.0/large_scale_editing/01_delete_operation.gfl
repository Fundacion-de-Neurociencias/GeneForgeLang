# DESCRIPTION: A compliant engine must understand the 'delete' operation.
# It must identify the 'locus(FXN_GAA_RepeatExpansion)' and simulate its elimination from the genome.

loci:
  - id: FXN_GAA_RepeatExpansion
    type: "repeat_expansion"
    chromosome: "chr9"
    start: 69028960
    end: 69029960

        operation:
          delete: locus(FXN_GAA_RepeatExpansion)
