# GFL Benchmark Design

## 1. Parsing Robustness
- Test all valid and invalid expressions.

## 2. Expressivity
- Encode complex genotypes: compound heterozygosity, polygenic traits.

## 3. Interoperability
- Convert between GFL and formats like VCF, GFF3, BED.

## 4. Usability
- Evaluate ease of annotation by biomedical users with different backgrounds.
