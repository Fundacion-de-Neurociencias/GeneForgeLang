# GeneForgeLang v1.0.0 Release Announcement

## üéâ We're Excited to Announce the Release of GeneForgeLang v1.0.0! üéâ

We're thrilled to announce the official release of GeneForgeLang (GFL) v1.0.0, a major milestone in our journey to revolutionize genomic workflow automation. This release represents months of dedicated development and introduces groundbreaking features that position GFL as the most advanced and extensible genomic workflow language available.

## üöÄ What's New in v1.0.0

### Advanced AI Workflow Syntax
GFL v1.0.0 introduces powerful new syntax extensions that enable sophisticated AI-driven workflows:
- **Active Learning Optimization**: Enhanced optimize blocks with Active Learning strategy support
- **Inverse Design**: Extended design blocks for inverse design workflows
- **Data Refinement**: New refine_data blocks for intelligent data preprocessing
- **Guided Discovery**: Revolutionary guided_discovery blocks that combine generative design with active learning

### IO Contracts System
Data integrity is critical in genomic workflows. Our new IO Contracts system ensures compatibility between workflow blocks with:
- Static compatibility checking between block outputs and inputs
- Strong typing for genomic data with built-in validation
- Support for both built-in and custom data types

### Type System & Schema Registry
GFL is now more extensible than ever with our powerful Schema Registry:
- Define custom data types in external schema files
- Import schema definitions with the new `import_schemas` directive
- Use custom types in IO contracts for domain-specific validation

## üß™ Key Features

### AI-Powered Workflows
- **Generative Design**: AI models for protein, DNA, and molecule generation
- **Intelligent Optimization**: Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithms, and active learning
- **Parameter Injection**: Dynamic parameter substitution with `${...}` syntax
- **Workflow Integration**: Seamless combination of design and optimization blocks

### Developer Experience
- **Enhanced Validation**: Rich error reporting with location tracking and suggested fixes
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing workflows continue to work without modification
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete guides and tutorials for all new features

## üåü Impact for the GeneForge Community

### For Researchers
- Accelerate discovery with AI-driven experimental design
- Reduce errors with automated data integrity checking
- Customize workflows for domain-specific requirements

### For Developers
